            I am a 4th year student at Imperial College London on my way to obtaining
            my degree in MEng Electronic and Information Engineering.
            <br />
            After completing my 6-month Industrial Placement at
            Amazon.com, Inc. as a Systems Development Engineer Intern I have returned
            to London for my final year at College.
            <br />
            I am passionate about Cloud Computing, Systems Design and their
            application in modern technologies and strive towards becoming a
            successful Engineer.
